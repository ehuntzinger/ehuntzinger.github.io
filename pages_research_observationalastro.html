							<h1>Nebular O<sup>++</sup> Abundances in HII regions</h1>
							<p>The way a galaxy forms and evolves is set by the balance between the gas accretion, star formation, and gas outflows of the galaxy. At the center of such evolution lie HII regions, also referred to as "star forming regions". HII regions are home to young, massive, hot stars which are paramount in dictating how a galaxy's chemical composition changes over time, a process known as chemical evolution. Measuring a galaxy's present chemical composition, then, is quite useful if one seeks to understand its evolutionary history.</p>
							<p>Nebular oxygen emission lines originating in HII regions are the most common tracers of gas-phase abundances used in chemical evolution studies due to their prevalence in spectra. One can make a "direct" measurement of the oxygen abundance of a particular oxygen ion using emission lines resulting from either the collisional excitation of an oxygen ion, or from its recombination with an electron. Abundance measurements of a specific ion should yield the same result regardless of which type of emission line is used to trace it, and yet, nebular oxygen abundances measured in HII regions using <!--collisionally excited lines (CELs) are systematically lower than those measured using recombination lines (RLs) -->the two methods disagree by a well-established factor of ~0.2-0.3 dex, a difference known as the Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF).</p>
							<!--O<sup>++</sup> is a common tracer of the nebular oxygen abundance for both types of emission lines and as such, the measured metallicities should very well agree. -->
							<p>At this time, the physical driver behind the ADF has not yet been conclusively identified, and the full picture of how HII regions work remains unknown. The most commonly cited explanation behind the ADF is the presence of small-scale temperature fluctuations (<i>t <sup>2</sup></i>) affecting the abundances measured by collisionally excited lines (CELs).</p>
							<p>In my work, I used O<sup>++</sup> optical ([OIII]4363/4959) and UV (OIII]1666/[OIII]4959) emission emission line ratios to make two independent direct electron temperature measurements for three HII regions in order to directly measure the magnitude of temperature fluctuations. The optical and UV temperatures were in rough agreement with one another, and as a result, the <i>t <sup>2</sup></i> I measured for the three objects was not sufficient to explain the ADF, with additional uncertainties arising from the analysis.</p>
